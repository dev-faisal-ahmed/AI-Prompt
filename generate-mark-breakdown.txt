# I need to implement a function
- That takes input 
	- marks object which type Record<string, number>
	- SubjectType => CQ_MCQ, CQ_MCQ_PRACTICAL, WRITTEN_FULL, WRITTEN_HALF

Now based on that marks object has keys like => cq, mcq, practical, written

- When Subject Type 
	CQ_MCQ => 
		cq full marks => 70 and pass marks is 23,
		mcq full marks => 30 and pass marks is 10

	CQ_MCQ_PRACTICAL => 
		cq full => 50. pass => 17
		mcq full => 25, pass => 8 
		practical full => 25, pass => 8 
	
	Written Full => 
		written full => 100, pass 33
	
	Written Half => 
		written full => 50, pass 17


Now based on that generate me an object of array where I enter marks, subjectType 

and I will get return as a result => 

{
	title : cq,
	obtainedMarks: 
	totalMarks: 
	passMarks:  
}
	
can you generate me this function with clean and readable with performance in mind
